# MITE-Su25-Cellular-Automata: Conway's Game of Life & Materials Science

This project was created as part of the **My Introduction to Engineering (MITE)  Summer 2025 Program** at **UT Austin**. It uses **Conwayâ€™s Game of Life** to introduce the basics of computational modeling and cellular automata in an interactive, beginner-friendly way. As a stretch goal, we aim to connect the pattern-forming behavior of the simulation to real materials science phenomena like **spinodal decomposition**.

It is recommended that this demonstration is completed using Google Colab
